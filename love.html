        <h2>Love & Relationships</h2>
        <p1>I had been in a relationship before and was the best feeling I ever got ater a decade everything was so beautiful but soon the dreams became nightmares and I started hating the feeling of LOVE </p1>
        <p2>I was depressed and anxious all the time and the worst part was even my family and friends didn't gave a FUCK and I literally had thoughts of ending my life several times. I tried (I'm Sorry) to end myself a couple of times sometimes i was not lucky enough sometimes GOD saved me. I was a happy kid but with time i developed social anxity and everytime i was surrounded but people i felt suffocated and started shivering my condition was getting worse </p2>
        <p3>Then 14th October 2023 I texted a girl (Can't tell her name as this is public) on her birthday just to wish her. I never knew wishing someone would one day lead to such deep and long conversations. She made me realise my worth and brought a smile on my face. But the journey was not that easy, at the begening I was even scared to meet her in real life and when I did, I was so fuckin scared but slowly i started to meet her more oftenly and became habbitual to meeting her. She I really don't know how but brings joy to me even if she drops me a text. Sometimes I even can't believe that the one who was so against LOVE fell again and this thime harder and deeper. </p3>
        <p4>But this time I know that I can't let myself break again and I also can't let this girl suffer as she had been through a lot in her past and i had seen the pain in her eyes. So this thime it's my responsiblity to take care of her treat her the way she deserves and make her feel what REAL LOVE id</p4>
        <p5>So with the knowledge of fuck ups from my past and the feeling stronger then never before I would Love to start a new story that ends with turning in ashes together. I LOVE YOU BBYGIRL please give me an opurtinity to make things works and give you the best and the last relationship u can ever think of........</p5>
